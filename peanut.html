<p class="p1">BIG THEIF TELLS FANS TO CAN IT </p>


<p class="p2"> I JUST NEEDED TO VENT ABOUT THAT BIG THIEF INSTAGRAM POST ABOUT BEING QUIET DURING SHOWS. FIRST OF ALL I  HAVE BEEN A FAN SINCE DAY 1 AND I’VE ACTUALLY SEEN THEM THREE TIMES, TWICE WITH FRIENDS AND ONCE ALONE. MY FRIENDS AND I ARE RESPECTFUL LISTENERS AND GO TO SHOWS SPECIFICALLY FOR THE MUSIC, BUT THE FACT IS THEY’RE A POPULAR BAND AND THEY SELL OUT SHOWS, SO THE CROWDS ARE USUALLY PRETTY LARGE. I’M PRETTY SURE EVERYONE IS EXTRA EXCITED TO GO OUT NOWADAYS WITH COVID RESTRICTION BEING LIFTED, SO PEOPLE JUST WANT TO BE OUT AND TALK WITH THEIR FRIENDS AND GO SEE A GOOD SHOW. THEN THE VIDEO WITH LORDE SHUSHING HER FANS DURING THE SET?! I GET WHERE SHE’S COMING FROM BUT IT’S JUST NOT POSSIBLE TO HAVE COMPLETE SILENCE 100% OF THE TIME... JUST TURN THE MICS UP? <br><br><br>

<p class="p2"> WHAT IS THE DEAL WITH EVERY SINGLE SHOW LATELY IN THE CITY BEING RUN BY DAN BURKE? MY GIRLFRIEND ISN’T A FAN OF HIM SO I’VE TRIED TO AVOID HIS STUFF BUT IT SEEMS LIKE EVERY SINGLE SHOW OF NOTE IS BEING RUN UNDER HIS NAME. ARE THERE ANY OTHER PROMOTERS LEFT IN TORONTO ACTUALLY PUTTING TALENT ON STAGE, OR DID BURKE HAVE THEM ALL KIDNAPPED AND RELCOATED TO NYC? JK, BUT SERIOUSLY.  <br><br><br>

    <p class="p1">BABY, PLEASE! AT BABY G </p>


<p class="p2"> I WAS AT THE PACKS SHOW LAST MONTH AT BABY G WAITING TO ORDER A DRINK AT THE BACK BAR AND THE COUPLE IN FRONT OF ME WERE OBVIOUSLY GETTING INTO SOME KIND OF DISAGREEMENT, BECAUSE THEY STARTED GETTING INTO THIS DEEP DISCUSSION WHEN THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO BE ORDERING AND THE BARTENDER HAD TO YELL AT THEM TO ORDER OR MOVE TO THE SIDE. I GOT MY DRINK AND WENT TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ROOM, BUT THREE OR FOUR SONGS INTO THE OPENING SET THEY STARTED BACK UP AGAIN LOUDLY ARGUING, AND IT STILL WASN’T SUPER FILLED OUT YET SO YOU COULD HEAR EVERYTHING. THE LAST THING I WANT TO HEAR WHEN I GO TO SEE A BAND IS LISTEN TO A COUPLE YELL PASSIVE AGRESSIVE STUFF AT EACH OTHER. PLEASE TAKE THIS OUTSIDE.  <br><br><br>
